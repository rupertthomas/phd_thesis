  abstract={Electrochemical discharge machining (ECDM) involves the electrolytic formation of a gas film at a tool electrode with high current density discharges and Joule heating for local material heating and removal. The ECDM process is ideally suited for low density glass through-hole machining for applications such as fluidic interconnection. In this paper, we describe a simple and robust ECDM cell arrangement and present optimum conditions for rapid and reproducible through-hole machining in both 500 um thick and fragile 180 um thin borosilicate glass substrates. Both anodic and cathodic methods were evaluated and the results offer additional insight into the complex and polarity-dependent mechanisms involved in the ECDM process. The anodic process produces unique spherical cavity microstructures, presenting a new capability for glass microfabrication.}

	abstract = {The Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorter (FACS) was invented in the late 1960s by Bonner, Sweet, Hulett, Herzenberg, and others to do flow cytometry and cell sorting of viable cells. Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems introduced the commercial machines in the early 1970s, using the Stanford patent and expertise supplied by the Herzenberg Laboratory and a Becton Dickinson engineering group under Bernie Shoor. Over the years, we have increased the number of measured FACS dimensions (parameters) and the speed of sorting to where we now simultaneously measure 12 fluorescent colors plus 2 scatter parameters. In this history, I illustrate the great utility of this state-of-the-art instrument, which allows us to simultaneously stain, analyze, and then sort cells from small samples of human blood cells from AIDS patients, infants, stem cell transplant patients, and others. I also illustrate analysis and sorting of multiple subpopulations of lymphocytes by use of 8-12 colors. In addition, I review single cell sorting used to clone and analyze hybridomas and discuss other applications of FACS developed over the past 30 years, as well as give our ideas on the future of FACS. These ideas are currently being implemented in new programs using the internet for data storage and analysis as well as developing new fluorochromes, e.g., green fluorescent protein and tandem dyes, with applications in such areas as apoptosis, gene expression, cytokine expression, cell biochemistry, redox regulation, and AIDS. Finally, I describe new FACS methods for measuring activated kinases and phosphatases and redox active enzymes in individual cells simultaneously with cell surface phenotyping. Thus, key functions can be studied in various subsets of cells without the need for prior sorting.

An efficient enrichment technique is Magnetic Cell Sorting (MACS) using the AutoMACS separator. However, evaluation of purity, recovery and applicability for PCR-based chimerism analysis of MACS-enriched subpopulations from post-transplant peripheral blood, providing reduced cell numbers and/or unbalanced proportions of subpopulations, is currently unavailable. We performed enrichment of CD3-, CD14-, CD15-, CD19- and CD56-positive subpopulations using 'Whole Blood MicroBeads' and AutoMACS separator in 137 prospectively collected peripheral blood samples from 15 paediatric patients after allo-CD3-/CD19-depleted SCT. Purity was assessed by immune phenotyping. Recovery and applicability for chimerism analysis was evaluated. Excellent purity >90\% was achieved in CD14-, CD15-positive cells in 81\%, 95\% of the isolates and in 86\% of CD3 and CD19 isolates, if ACC was >400 cells per mul. Median purity of CD56-positive isolates was 78.9\%. Recovery >90\% was between 93 (CD56) and 37\% (CD15). Conventional and real-time PCR-based chimerism analysis was feasible in virtually all samples. Isolation of cell subpopulations by automated cell enrichment in post-transplant peripheral blood is feasible and fast providing excellent purity and recovery for routine lineage-specific chimerism analysis.Bone Marrow Transplantation advance online publication, 4 May 2009; doi:10.1038/bmt.2009.89.

  abstract={Over the last century a number of techniques have been developed which allow the measurement of the dielectric properties of biological particles in fluid suspension. The majority of these techniques are limited by the fact that they only provide an average value for the dielectric properties of a collection of particles. More recently, with the advent of microfabrication techniques and the Lab-on-a-chip, it has been possible to perform dielectric spectroscopic experiments on single biological particles suspended in physiological media. In this paper we review current methods for single cell dielectric spectroscopy. We also discuss alternative single cell dielectric measurement techniques, specifically the ac electrokinetic methods of dielectrophoresis and electrorotation. Single cell electrical impedance spectroscopy is also discussed with relevance to a microfabricated flow cytometer. We compare impedance spectroscopy data obtained from measurements made using a microfabricated flow cytometer with simulation data obtained using an equivalent circuit model for the device.}
